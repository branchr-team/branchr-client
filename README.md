# branchr-client
The web client for Branchr.

## Installation

`npm install`

Ensure you have gulp installed globally: `npm install -g gulp`.

## Usage

`gulp serve` will automatically install bower dependencies, run the build process, 
and serve the build at `localhost:8000`. If in dev mode (the default), it will also
watch your files for changes.
